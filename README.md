# 1D Divergence-Dependent Simulation (Starter Repo)

This repository contains exploratory code for simulating 1D advection-diffusion equations with divergence-dependent velocity fields using Monte Carlo methods. It serves as a sandbox for testing numerical strategies, analyzing stochastic behavior, and refining ideas for higher-dimensional extensions.

## üîç Project Overview

The simulation models particle paths governed by PDEs of the form:

‚àÇT/‚àÇt = ‚àá¬∑(D(x)‚àáT) - ‚àá¬∑(u(x)T)

Key focuses include:
- Implementation of divergence-dependent drift
- Histogram-based density estimation
- Comparison with exact solutions
- Post-simulation statistics and visualization
